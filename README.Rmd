**trajclass** provides tools for creating, manipulating, and analyzing standardized longitudinal trajectory objects (time series) in long format.

### Main features (current version)

- Create clean, standardized trajectory objects with columns `id`, `time`, `y` (outcome variable)
- Automatic class dispatch:  
  - `traj_0` — empty (zero rows/subjects)  
  - `traj_1` — single subject/trajectory  
  - `traj_m` — multiple subjects/trajectories  
- Subsetting with `subset_traj()` (generic with methods for each subclass)
- Rich metadata attached as attributes (`data_info` and `status`)

Classification of trajectories into patterns (linear, quadratic, hockey-stick) will be added in future versions.

### Installation

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("agalecki-work/trajclass")
